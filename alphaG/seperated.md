# Game Mode: Separated

## Core Concept

In this innovative game mode, players begin as abstract points navigating a neural-generated background containing autonomous characters. These points must strategically converge to "attract" background characters, triggering a transformation sequence where both points and background characters emerge into the foreground as fully playable entities.

## Gameplay Flow

### Phase 1: Point Navigation

Players exist as simple points moving through complex, ever-changing background environments populated with conversing characters. The primary objective is to position these points to attract the attention of background characters through proximity and movement patterns.

### Phase 2: Character Attraction

Background characters continuously engage in conversations and activities, oblivious to the players' presence until specific attention-grabbing conditions are met. When either point successfully draws a character's attention, both points automatically converge, initiating the transformation sequence.

### Phase 3: Emergence Transformation

The background characters detach from their environment, bringing with them visual elements that coalesce into coherent forms. Simultaneously, player points transform into fully embodied characters, all emerging into the foreground layer as playable entities.

### Phase 4: Embodied Exploration

Once in character form, players gain an expanded movement vocabulary that directly influences the background environment:

- Forward movement: Progresses deeper into the current background scene
- Backward movement: Withdraws from the scene, potentially returning to a more abstract state
- Lateral movement: Transitions to adjacent background environments
- Gestures: Introduces specific objects or triggers universe variations based on hand positions and movements

## Technical Systems

### Character Conversation System

- Autonomous dialogue generation between background characters
- Contextual awareness to detect player point proximity and movement
- Attention mechanics with visual cues indicating successful attraction

### Spatial Navigation Framework

- Multidimensional background space with coherent traversal logic
- Mapping between physical movements and conceptual scene transitions
- Background transformation that maintains visual continuity during transitions

### Gesture Recognition Interface

- Hand position tracking with semantic meaning assignment
- Object manifestation based on gesture vocabulary
- Universe-altering gestures that trigger background seed modifications

### Emergence Choreography

- Synchronized visual transformation sequences
- Character attributes inherited from background visual elements
- Seamless transition between passive observation and active control

## Experiential Goals

### Collaborative Discovery

Players must coordinate their point movements to successfully attract and transform background characters, encouraging cooperation and communication.

### Environmental Dialogue

The relationship between player movement and environmental response creates a visual conversation, with the background acting as both canvas and interlocutor.

### Embodied Agency

The transition from abstract point to embodied character represents an evolution of player capability and connection to the environment, creating a powerful sense of emergence and manifestation.

### Universe Manipulation

Gesture-based environmental alterations allow players to shape reality according to their collaborative vision, turning exploration into creation.
