# Project Evolution: Neural Reality Sampler

**Advanced Concept:**
The system evolves into a "reality sampling" experience where:

1. **AGI-Driven Recording:** An AI autonomously guides the character through infinite background configurations, periodically resting in whitespace

2. **Player as Observer/Selector:** Your role shifts from directly controlling movement to strategically interrupting the automated journey

3. **Input System:** Like complex easter egg combinations, you input specific patterns to halt the character at precise moments, capturing specific reality states

4. **Meta-Gameplay:** The challenge becomes learning how to "catch" desired backgrounds by predicting patterns and executing well-timed interventions

This creates a fascinating inversion of traditional gameplay - instead of navigating toward goals, you're selectively freezing motion to capture fleeting moments of beauty or interest from an otherwise autonomous journey.
